# Frosting CSS Library

Every cake needs a little frosting! Add some flair to your project
by adding some Frosting style.

Our components, guidelines, and regulations are currently baking right now
and we will notify you when they are hot out the oven!

## Icons

We use Google's Material Icons because they are open source and have a very
minimalist design. To use this icon library, be sure to include the following
in the `<head>` of your HTML file:

`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">`
